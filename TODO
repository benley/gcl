USE CASES FOR CODE INSIGHT

- Point at variable, see value, see where it is defined
- Point at definition, see current expansion?
- Floating autocomplete: find all variables in scope
- Deref autocomplete: finish members
- Underline parse errors


THINGS TO CHECK
---------------

base
composite tuples
inherited tuples
with inherit fields

TODO LATER
----------

Figure out where time is going and optimize, we've gotten slower (probably
because of more backtracking allowed).
